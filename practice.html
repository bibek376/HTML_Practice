<p title="About Car"> <b>car</b> (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. <i>Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads</i>, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3]
Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and <em>developed economies depend on them</em>. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern <strong>car</strong> when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.

<p title="About Cat">
    The <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
